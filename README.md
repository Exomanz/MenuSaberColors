# ConsistentSaberColors
A Quest mod that allowed for your menu pointers to be the same colors as your sabers has been ported to PC!

## Overview - What exactly does this mod do?
Put simply, this mod just allows for your menu pointers to be the same colors as your in-level sabers!

There is no config for this mod--it comes enabled by default, and if you want to disable it, you will need to either uninstall the mod, or edit `Disabled Mods.json` in your UserData folder.
